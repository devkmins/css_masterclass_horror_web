        <p class="second__explain">
          “Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes I feel are some of the
          most affecting in horror. Some may be simple black cat scares, others
          may be more subdued or nuanced. Many come from films that aren't
          necessarily “horror” but have elements or threads of horror.

          Best Horror Scenes is a love letter to the Horror film genre by
          Brandon Durham. Most film clips contain major spoilers, and it is
          recommended you don’t watch the clip if you plan on seeing the film.

            So much has been written that there isn’t really much left to say.
            I’ll leave you with some recommendations that should help you get
            the most out of this film: Try to watch this film as
            distraction-free as possible. Lights out. No other audio. If you’re
            watching with others, try not to talk during the film. Turn on
            captions/subtitles. Without them you may not understand some of the
            dialog. Additionally, I found it much scarier when I heard something
            and subtitles would pop up telling me what the sound actually was. I
            follow these rules with virtually every film I watch, but it’s
            especially important with Skinamarink. The pace is glacial, to say
            the least. As expected, many Horror fans have been very vocal about
            just how slow this film is, but I find it absolutely necessary for
            the story. It’s all about making the viewer come closer. Pulling
            them into the room with Kaylee, Kevin, and whatever else might be
            lurking in the darkness. If you can be patient and succumb to the
            atmosphere, you might just find yourself experiencing something like
            you’ve never experienced before.
